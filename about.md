The IOOS Notebook Gallery is a collection of tutorials and examples of how to access and utilize the many IOOS technologies and data sources available.  This site is geared towards scientists and environmental managers intersted in "diving deep" into the numbers and creating orginal plots and data analysis. Most notebooks will be examples using Python code.  Over time, we plan to include notebooks with Matlab, R, and GIS code as well. The notebooks will come from a variety of authors including IOOS Program Office Staff, Regional Association data managers, and other IOOS partners.  If you think you have a nice example you would like to share please let us know!

Feedback and questions are welcome.  Please contact us at data.ioos@noaa.gov
